# Hospital Monitoring System - Group $

## Project Overview
This project, developed by our team, aims to optimize heart rate monitoring in a hospital setting using Linux-based shell scripting. The system records heart rate data, archives logs with timestamps, and securely backs up the data to a remote server. This ensures smooth monitoring and data handling for better patient care.

- Records heart rate data every second.
